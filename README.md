# SIUE CS Page Materials

As an Instructor of Computer Science at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, I maintain a collection of webpages and tools here. For the time-being, the layout is pretty straightforward:

```
.
├── README.md
└── websites
    └── www.cs
        ├── index.html
        ├── main.js
        └── Makefile

3 directories, 4 files
```

Open course materials may be placed here from time-to-time as well.
